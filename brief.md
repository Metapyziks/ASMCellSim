# Programmable Multicellular Organism Simulation
## Background
The simulation of a system with relatively simple rules can lead to interesting
and often unexpected emergent behaviours. The most fascinating and diverse
product that has emerged from this universe is arguably life, with its ability
to constantly adapt and reinvent itself to exist in disparate and extreme
environments. The evolution of multicellularity opened the way to the
development of far more complex organisms that overcome complex problems in
their environment.

This project will attempt to implement a simulation of simple abstracted cells
which are able to interact in a way that supports symbiotic multicellular
structures to emerge. A visualisation of the simulation will also be produced
to provide an insight into the configurations of the emerging organisms and
their behaviours.

## Aims
### Simulation
A program will be produced to simulate a collection of simple cells existing on
a Cartesian plane. Each cell requires the absorption of nutrients from its
environment in order to function. Cell will contain a sequence of genetic code
which encodes a program that governs the activities of that cell. Possible
actions include self propulsion, attaching to and detaching from neighbouring
cells, transferring nutrients to attached cells, sending messages to attached
cells, and reproduction through cell division. These interactions should be
able to support a large range of possible emergent behaviours, including
predatory, symbiotic and parasitic relationships between organisms.

#### Evolutionary Simulation
It will be possible to introduce the possibility of mutation during cellular
division, which will allow the simulation of natural selection.

#### Simulation of Prefabricated Organisms
There will also be the possibility to initiate a simulation with a collection
of pre-designed organisms. The genetic code for these organisms would be
produced through assembling programs written in a simple programming language.
This could be branched into an educational programming game where players
attempt to implement organisms to compete against those designed by opponents.
